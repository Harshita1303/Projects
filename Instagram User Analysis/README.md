These insights will support informed decisions by the product, marketing, and development teams, guiding the future direction of the app and enhancing user experience.
## Approach
In this project, I leveraged MySQL to extract and analyze data from the provided database. 

## Tech Stack Used
- SQL

## Marketing Analysis
###  1.Loyal User Reward
**Task:** Identify the five oldest users on Instagram from the provided database.
```sql
SELECT 
    username
FROM
    users
ORDER BY created_at
LIMIT 5;
```

### 2.Inactive User Engagement
**Task:** Identify users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram.

```sql
SELECT 
    username
FROM
    users
WHERE
    id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT
            user_id
        FROM
            photos);

# Alter
SELECT 
    users.username
FROM
    users
        LEFT JOIN
    photos ON users.id = photos.user_id
WHERE
    photos.id IS NULL;
```

### 3.Contest Winner Declaration
**Task:** Determine the winner of the contest and provide their details to the team.

```sql
SELECT 
    username, 
    photos.id,
    photos.image_url,
    COUNT(likes.user_id) AS total
FROM 
    photos
INNER JOIN 
    likes ON likes.photo_id = photos.id
INNER JOIN 
    users ON photos.user_id = users.id
GROUP BY 
    photos.id
ORDER BY 
    total DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
### 4.Hashtag Research
**Task:** Identify and suggest the top five most commonly used hashtags on the platform.
```sql
select
tags.tag_name, count(photo_tags.photo_id) as tags_count 
from tags
inner join photo_tags
on tags.id = photo_tags.tag_id
group by tags.tag_name
order by tags_count desc
limit 5;
```
### 5.Ad Campaign Launch
Task: Determine the day of the week when most users register on Instagram. Provide insights on when to schedule an ad campaign.

```sql
SELECT 
    DAYNAME(created_at) AS days,
    COUNT(id) AS days_count
FROM
    users
GROUP BY days
ORDER BY days_count DESC;
```

## Sales & Insight
