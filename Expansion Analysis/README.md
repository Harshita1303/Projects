## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment & Data Setup
##### Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv my_env
my_env\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
```

##### Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install pandas pymysql sqlalchemy
```

### 2. Download Dataset using Kaggle API
1. Set up Kaggle API by placing `kaggle.json` in the `.kaggle/` directory.
2. Download the [Monday Coffee Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najir0123/monday-coffee-sql-data-analysis-project/) dataset using the following command:
```bash
kaggle datasets download -d najir0123/monday-coffee-sql-data-analysis-project
```

### 3. Data Preprocessing & MySQL Integration
##### Clean the Data using Pandas
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df1 = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")
df2 = pd.read_csv("products.csv")

# Handle missing values and duplicates
df1.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
df1.dropna(inplace=True) # insignificant

# Converting Datatype
df2['price'].str.replace('$', '').astype(float)
```

##### Store Cleaned Data in MySQL
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine_mysql = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://root:password@localhost/mondaycoffee')
df.to_sql('sales', con=engine_mysql, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```

---
## üìä Power BI Dashboard Setup
### 1. Connect Power BI with MySQL
- Use **"Get Data" ‚Üí "MySQL Database"**.
- Enter **database credentials**.
- Import cleaned data for visualization.

### 2. Create DAX: Calculated Columns and Measures
#### Measures:
```DAX
Total Revenue = SUM(sales[total])
Unit Sales = COUNT(Sales[product_id])
Total Rent = sum(city[estimated_rent])
Coffee Consumers = SUM(city[population]) * 0.25
Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(sales[customer_id])
Average Sales Per Customers = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Customers])
Average Rent per Customers = DIVIDE(SUM(City[estimated_rent]), [Total Customers])
```
#### Calculated Columns:
```DAX
Year = YEAR('Calendar'[Date])
Month Number = MONTH('Calendar'[Date])
Month Prefix = FORMAT('Calendar'[Date], "mmm")
```

### 3. Dashboard Visuals
| Visualization | Data Used | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| üìà **Revenue (Line Chart)** | City vs. Total Revenue | Shows revenue trends across cities |
| üìä **Sales vs Rent (Bar & Line Chart)** | Avg Rent & Avg Sales | Compare cost-effectiveness across cities |
| üìä **Coffee Consumers (Bar Chart)** | City vs Total Consumers | Identifies top cities for coffee consumption |
| üìä **Top 5 Cities by Customers (Bar Chart)** | City vs Total Customers | Highlights key customer locations |
| üçé **Top 5 Products (Pie Chart)** | Product vs Sales % | Displays best-selling products |

### 4. Filters & Interactivity
- **Date Filter:** Analyze sales by custom time ranges.
- **Product Filter:** Filter sales by different coffee products.
- **City Filter:** Focus on specific cities for localized insights.

## üìÑ Documentation & Publishing
- Store all **SQL queries & scripts** in an organized folder.
- Maintain a well-documented **README** for clear workflow understanding.
- Export and share the **Power BI dashboard (.pbix)** for collaboration.

## üìå Business Problems & Solutions  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Coffee Consumers Count
**Problem:** Estimate how many people in each city consume coffee (assuming 25% of the population).  

```sql
SELECT 
    city_name AS City,
    population * 0.25 AS Coffee_Consumers
FROM
    city
ORDER BY Coffee_Consumers DESC;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Total Revenue from Coffee Sales  
**Problem:** Calculate total revenue from coffee sales across all cities in Q4 of 2023.  

```sql
SELECT 
    ct.city_name AS City,
    SUM(s.total) AS Total_Revenue
FROM
    sales s
        INNER JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
        INNER JOIN city ct ON c.city_id = ct.city_id
WHERE
    s.sale_date BETWEEN '2023-09-01' AND '2023-12-31'
GROUP BY ct.city_name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Count for Each Product  
**Problem:** Determine the number of units sold for each coffee product.  

```sql
SELECT 
    p.product_name AS Product_Name,
    COUNT(s.product_id) AS Unit_Sales
FROM
    sales s
        LEFT JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY Unit_Sales DESC;
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Average Sales Amount per City  
**Problem:** Find the average sales amount per customer in each city.  

```sql
SELECT 
    ct.city_name AS City, 
    ROUND(SUM(s.total), 2) AS Total_Revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) AS Customers_Count,
    ROUND(SUM(s.total)/ COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id), 2) AS Average_Sales_Per_Customers
FROM 
    sales s
        INNER JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
        INNER JOIN city ct ON c.city_id = ct.city_id
GROUP BY ct.city_name   
ORDER BY Average_Sales_Per_Customers DESC;
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ City Population and Coffee Consumers

```sql
SELECT 
    ct.city_name AS City,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) AS Coffee_Consumers,
    ROUND(AVG(ct.population * 0.25) / 1000000, 2) AS Population_In_Millions
FROM
    sales s
        INNER JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id

    ct.city_name AS City,
    p.product_name AS Product,
    COUNT(s.product_id) AS Sales_Volume,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY ct.city_name ORDER BY COUNT(s.product_id) DESC) AS Ranks
FROM
    sales s
        INNER JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
        INNER JOIN city ct ON c.city_id = ct.city_id
        INNER JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY ct.city_name, p.product_name

)
SELECT 
	cr.city_name,
	ct.Average_Sales_Per_Customers,
	ROUND(estimated_rent/ct.Customers_Count, 2) AS Average_Rent_Per_Customers
FROM 
	city_table ct 
	INNER JOIN city_rent cr ON cr.city_name = ct.City;
```

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Monthly Sales Growth

		City, Sales_Month, Sales_Year, 
		Total_Sales AS Current_Sales, 
		LAG(Total_Sales, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY City ORDER BY Sales_Year, Sales_Month) AS Previous_Sales 
	FROM monthly_sales
)
SELECT City, Sales_Month, Sales_Year, 
	Current_Sales, Previous_Sales, 
	ROUND(((Current_Sales - Previous_Sales)/Previous_Sales)*100, 2) AS Growth_Rate
FROM growth_ratio
WHERE Previous_Sales IS NOT NULL;
```
