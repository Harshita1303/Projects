## üîß Setup Instructions

### **1. Environment & Data Setup**
#### **Create a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

#### **Install Required Libraries**
```bash
pip install pandas pymysql sqlalchemy
```

### **2. Download Dataset using Kaggle API**
1. Set up Kaggle API by placing `kaggle.json` in the `.kaggle/` directory.
2. Download the [Monday Coffee Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najir0123/monday-coffee-sql-data-analysis-project/) dataset using the following command:
```bash
kaggle datasets download -d najir0123/monday-coffee-sql-data-analysis-project
```
3. Extract and place the dataset inside the **data/** folder.

### **3. Data Preprocessing & MySQL Integration**
#### **Clean the Data using Pandas**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")

# Handle missing values and duplicates
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
```

#### **Store Cleaned Data in MySQL**
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://root:password@localhost/mondaycoffee')
df.to_sql('sales', con=engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```

---
## üìä Power BI Dashboard Setup
### **1. Connect Power BI with MySQL**
- Use **"Get Data" ‚Üí "MySQL Database"**.
- Enter **database credentials**.
- Import cleaned data for visualization.

### **2. Create DAX Measures**
```DAX
Total Revenue = SUM(Sales[Revenue])
Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[Customer_ID])
Average Sales Per Customer = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Customers])
Total Coffee Consumers = SUM(Sales[Customers])
```

### **3. Dashboard Visuals**
| Visualization | Data Used | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| üìà **Revenue (Line Chart)** | City vs. Total Revenue | Shows revenue trends across cities |
| üìä **Sales vs Rent (Bar & Line Chart)** | Avg Rent & Avg Sales | Compare cost-effectiveness across cities |
| üìä **Coffee Consumers (Bar Chart)** | City vs Total Consumers | Identifies top cities for coffee consumption |
| üìä **Top 5 Cities by Customers (Bar Chart)** | City vs Total Customers | Highlights key customer locations |
| üçé **Top 5 Products (Pie Chart)** | Product vs Sales % | Displays best-selling products |

### **4. Filters & Interactivity**
- **Date Filter:** Analyze sales by custom time ranges.
- **Product Filter:** Filter sales by different coffee products.
- **City Filter:** Focus on specific cities for localized insights.

---
## üìÑ Documentation & Publishing
- Store all **SQL queries & scripts** in an organized folder.
- Maintain a well-documented **README** for clear workflow understanding.
- Export and share the **Power BI dashboard (.pbix)** for collaboration.

---
## üöÄ Future Enhancements
- **Customer Segmentation Analysis** based on purchase behavior.
- **Predictive Analytics** for future sales trends.
- **Automated Data Refresh** in Power BI.

```

## Results & Insights
After analyzing the data, the recommended top three cities for new store openings are:

**City 1: Pune**  
- Average rent per customer is very low.  
- Highest total revenue.  
- Average sales per customer is also high.

**City 2: Delhi**  
- Highest estimated coffee consumers at 7.7 million.  
- Highest total number of customers, which is 68.  
- Average rent per customer is 330 (still under 500).

**City 3: Jaipur**  
- Highest number of customers, which is 69.
- Average rent per customer is very low at 156.
