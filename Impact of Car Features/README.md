## Objective 
The objective of this project is to dentify which features and categories are most popular among consumers and most profitable for the manufacturer.The main aim is to help a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize the profitability while meeting customers demand. This could help the manufacturer improve its competitiveness in the market and increase its profitablitity over time.

## Approach
### Data Collection
-	Set up Kaggle API by placing kaggle.json in the .kaggle/ directory.
-	Downloaded the dataset using kaggle datasets download -d CooperUnion/cardataset.
### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 
-	Imported required libraries and handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
-	Performed data transformation and outlier detection.
-	Standardized data formats and ensured consistency for analysis.
### Data Analysis & Visualization 
-	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pivot tables, filters, and formulas.
-	Created statistical summaries and performed trend analysis.
-	Developed charts and graphs (scatter plots, histograms, regression analysis) to identify key insights.
### Dashboard & Reporting
-	Designed an interactive dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs).
-	Integrated slicers, and filters for dynamic data exploration.
### Documentation 
-	Documented project objectives, methodology, findings, and insights.
-	Included visual representations, observations, and recommendations.

## Tools & Technology
-	Python (Pandas) – Used for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Jupyter Notebook – A code editor for writing and executing scripts.
- Microsoft Excel – Utilized for data analysis, pivot tables, and visualization.
- Tableau – A data visualization tool for dashboard creation and insights generation.
- Microsoft Word – Used for project documentation.
- Kaggle API – Facilitates dataset retrieval from Kaggle.

## Business Problem Addressed
1.	How does the popularity of a car model vary across different market categories?
2.	What is the relationship between a car's engine power and its price?
3.	Which car features are most important in determining a car's price? 
4.	How does the average price of a car vary across different manufacturers?
5.	What is the relationship between fuel efficiency and the number of cylinders in a car's engine?

## Dashboard
1. How does the distribution of car prices vary by brand and body style?
2. Which car brands have the highest and lowest average MSRPs, and how does this vary by body style?
3. How do the different feature such as transmission type affect the MSRP, and how does this vary by body style?
4. How does the fuel efficiency of cars vary across different body styles and model years?
5. How does the car's horsepower, MPG, and price vary across different Brands?
